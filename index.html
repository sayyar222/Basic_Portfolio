<p>An adventurous 24 year old gearhead who thinks it's important to obtain basic coding knowledge in order to survive in the Bay Area. 
    I love my 2 year old German Sheprador more than most humans. I have an interest in basically anything that can go fast, from motorcycles to jets and everything in between.
    If I'm not in class or at work, I typically spend my free time roaming the rollins hills, local farmers markets and the like. A lot of my experience lies in the automotive industry, though I'm enrolled in this bootcamp because I'm hoping to take a different direction in my life.

    I consider myself a doctor of self, in which everyone is I believe. You have the power and the knowledge, though it may be undiscovered, to heal yourself of all physical, mental, emotional and spiritual injuries. 
    One of a million dreams of mine would be to start a non-profit organization someday, working directly with underprivileged kids.
